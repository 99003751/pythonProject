# About the project

The aim of the project is to extract the data present in different spreadsheets in one excel file as required by the user. 
The excel sheet consists of 5 spreadsheets with the following data:

- Name
- PS Number
- Postal Address
- Address
- City
- Company
- Country

The user defines the data that needs to be searched on the basis of Name and PS Number. The python program then reads the data corresponding to the particular data 
from different spreadsheets of excel. It then creates a mastersheet and adds the data from all the sheets to it. 
In the end, the data to be provided to the user is printed to the console.
